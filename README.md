The basis of this project is to build a data-driven application that loads and presents data from a JSON object.

Requirements:

- Driven by data nested at least 3 levels deep

- Overlays that provide more detail about an object or piece of information

- Animated transitions between states

- A data store for querying, interacting with, and manipulating data

- One component that modifies and updates the data in some way (changes names, updates stats, adds new items)

- 4+ distinct components.

- Written in React
